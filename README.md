# 👋🏼 Hi there!

Welcome to my Git space. This is a playground for my work records, experiments, and coding projects.

# 🙆🏻‍♀️ About me

Call me Era.

I'm a Technical Writer with a small background in marketing and several years' experience in the software development scene.

Currently, I am seeking technical/UX writing opportunities in Sydney, Australia. Ideally I'd like to contribute to product/service design companies that value inclusivity, diversity, and learning.

For my qualifications and further details, view my portfolio (which I coded myself!).
